My name is Jackson Melchert and I am current a PhD Student in the at {{< staticref "https://stanfordaccelerate.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Stanford Accelerate Lab{{< /staticref >}}  at Stanford University. My research is currently focused on how to generate an optimal coarse-grained reconfigurable array processing element architecture for a given application domain. I am developing tools to analyze the applications that are going to be run on the CGRA to identify interesting PE architectures to be evaluated. I am also developing a PE generator that takes a high level specification of a PE from the application analysis and produces the hardware description of the PE, along with functional and formal models used in the application mapping process. I am broadly interested in optimizing configurable hardware to approach the performance and efficiency of application specific accelerators.
